# Welcome to PRIME-RE
## The PRIMatE Resource Exchange

![logo](images/social_preview_image.png)

The preprocessing and analysis of nonhuman primate (NHP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data presents some unique challenges. Over the years, many laboratories and researchers have created their own custom solutions to many of these problems. PRIME-RE aims to provide an overview of the main difficulties and curate a collection of solutions that currently exist within the broader NHP-MRI community for specific processing steps that are commonly performed on NHP MRI data. Since this is a community effort, we strongly encourage you to contribute your workflows and pipelines. 

PRIME-RE is maintained by members of the [PRIME-DE consortium](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/indiPRIME.html).

# Templates and atlases
**Template:** A standard brain, typically used for registering multiple individuals into a common coordinate space. This space can be either volumetric (3D coordinates system), surface-based (mesh), or a combination of both.

**Atlas:** a percellation of the brain into areas, often provided in a specific template space. Atlases are typically used for defining regions-of-interest (ROIs) or for identifying the location of activation sites.

For human MRI, the [MNI template](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009) serves as the community standard volumetric template. Its integration into most major software packages makes it easy for researchers to register their results to MNI space. This facilitates data-sharing, cross-study comparisons and metanalyses. Most human brain atlases are also provided in MNI space. For surface-based analysis the [FsAverage](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsAverage) (freesurfer average) template serves the same purpose.

When it comes to NHP neuroimaging though, there are two complications:
1. The usage of multiple species creates the need for species-specific templates
2. Even for the most commonly imaged species (macaques and marmosets), multiple templates are available, with no single one of them adopted as the go-to community standard.

Below, we provide a non-exhaustive list of existing templates and atlases.

### Warps between macaque templates
Transforming data (e.g. parcellations, statistical maps) between the various template spaces requires the registration of those templates to one another. [Nikoloz Sirmpilatze](https://github.com/niksirbi) has done that for the first 5 templates on the above table, using [ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/). Find out more in this [github repository](https://github.com/niksirbi/Macaque_Template_Warps).
* [See how macaque template warps were computed](https://github.com/niksirbi/Macaque_Template_Warps/blob/master/macaque_template_warps.ipynb) 
* [See how to use macaque template warps](https://github.com/niksirbi/Macaque_Template_Warps/blob/master/how_to_apply_template_warps.ipynb)

The set of between-template warps are currently being tested and will be released soon. Preliminary access to the untested warps is available through [this download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8u6dt0t02gor213/AAD17Nbvhi5_4gku9xsYQKFNa?dl=1).

### Details
#### Diffusion-MRI by Rakshit
These [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/RDadarwal/Diffusion-MRI), provided by [Rakshit Dadarwal](https://github.com/RDadarwal), showcase  an example of diffusion MRI preprocessing and analysis with python. They include steps for basic preprocessing (denoising, susceptibility-induced distortion correction, eddy current-induced distortion and motion correction), model fitting (DTI, DKI, NODDI) and calculation of parametric maps. These steps use functions from [DIPY](https://dipy.org/), [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/), and [AMICO](https://github.com/daducci/AMICO).
