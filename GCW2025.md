# PRIME-DRE GCW 2025 
We are proud to announce the 2025 **PRIMatE Data and Resource Exchange (PRIME-DRE) Global Collaboration Workshop (GCW)**. This year’s workshop will again take place online on December 4-5, 2025 (9am-12pm EST / 3pm-6pm CET / 9pm-12am UTC+7). 

This year’s GCW will again bring together researchers and data scientists from across the PRIME-DRE network to share insights, explore new methodologies, and co-develop opportunities for collaboration. Whether you're working on neuroimaging, behavioral, electrophysiology or metadata, we look forward to hearing your voice in the conversation.
