# PRIME-DRE GCW 2024 
We are proud to announce the 2024 **PRIMatE Data and Resource Exchange (PRIME-DRE) Global Collaboration Workshop (GCW)**. This year’s workshop will take place online on December 3-4, 2024 (9:00AM-1:30PM EST). The meeting will focus on getting to know each other, our science, and initiatives with a similar scope as PRIME-DRE. We again aim to offer a place to start thinking about collaborative projects and bring together scientists from across the world.

## Pre-Workshop Videoconference Schedule
Following the model of previous meetings, there will be a few pre-workshop videoconferences to help get the conversations going prior to the workshop on December 3-4. This process is intended to facilitate more mature dialogues and brainstorming sessions at the in-person meeting.

Below is the pre-workshop schedule for each of the Topic Areas, which was based on the mutual availability of Topic Area co-leaders and advisors. Please feel free to join as many videoconferences as you would like – everyone’s participation is encouraged!

### Topic A: Bottom-up approaches towards multimodal functional connectomes      
~~5 November, 11 PM EST~~       
20 November, 11 PM EST         

### Topic B: Large-scale lifespan studies     
~~8 November, 12 PM EST~~      
22 November, 12 PM EST  			

**NB!** Links for the online pre-meetings have now been distributed through the [NHP-MRI mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/nhp-mri). If you did not get the links and would like to attend the links send us an [email](mailto:primate.dre?subject=[GCW2024]%20Premeetings) (please mention your affiliation/supervisor).   

## Other GCW content
In addition to the two break-out topics, the 2024 PRIME-DRE GCW will feature:

### Flash talks     
Both days will feature a flash talk session in which PRIME-DRE consortium members of all career stages will briefly present themselves and their scientific interests to the community.

### Similar initiatives and funding agencies    
There will be brief introductory presentations from initiatives that are similar to PRIME-DRE and we might learn from or connect with, as well from funding agencies to hear about the possibilities for PRIME-DRE related funding schemes.
