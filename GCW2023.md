# PRIME-DRE GCW 2023
We are proud to announce that the registration process for the **2023 PRIMatE Data and Resource Exchange (PRIME-DRE) Global Collaboration Workshop (GCW)**. The workshop will be held on July 26-27 at [The Neuro](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/) in Montreal. The registration link can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9mQD_0sOOX8_Ah9ZvRde6zVCz5GZtkQOfDs5Y1UJRw8afgQ/viewform).
 
Building on the successes of the 2019 and 2021 GCW workshops, we will again use a highly interactive breakout group-based format. There will be a specific focus on the advancement and/or generation of international collaborative project ideas in four key areas previously identified by the consortium. For each topic area, there will be two general co-leaders and up to 8 breakout leaders (we are still open to volunteers for those that would be interested). To ensure robust conversations at the workshop, we will again hold pre-workshop videoconference calls for each of the topic areas - these will be announced in the upcoming weeks.

**Topic Area 1: Comparative studies of brain development and its determinants across the lifespan**    
Topic Area Leaders: Alison Weiss, Ting Xu
Breakout Leaders: Justine Clery, Brad Hobson, Jakob Seidlitz & Suliann Ben Hamed     

**Topic Area 2: Linking primate brain function and organization across scales**    
Topic Area Leaders: Nicola Palomero-Gallagher, Anna Roe
Breakout Leaders: Chris Klink, Erika Raven, Brian Russ, Charlie Schroeder      

**Topic Area 3: Going from mouse to monkey to human: Methods and models for enabling multi-species comparative studies**    
Topic Area Leaders: Renee Hartig, Katja Heuer
Breakout Leaders: Mike Hawrylycz, Hank Jedema, Minqing Jiang, Amir Shmuel        

**Topic Area 4: Public outreach and importance of animal research**    
Topic Area Leaders: Nicole Eichert, Wendy Jarrett 
Breakout Leaders: Chris Petkov, Sally Thompson-Iritani       

The Neuro is an ideal location for this year’s GCW, as it is an integrated research institute and hospital dedicated to the principles of open science. We would like to thank the Director Guy Rouleau for hosting us and the Neuro Event teams, Boris Bernhardt and Justine Cléry for making the space available.
 
We appreciate that some may not be able to make it to the meeting in-person, but would like to participate. Accordingly, we will offer remote video attendance for those desiring to participate, though cannot guarantee that the experience will be equivalent to attending in-person. Please be sure to register: [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9mQD_0sOOX8_Ah9ZvRde6zVCz5GZtkQOfDs5Y1UJRw8afgQ/viewform).
 
We look forward to collaborating!

Best,
The PRIME-DRE Organizing Team
