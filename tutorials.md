# PRIME-RE wiki     
The [PRIME-RE wiki](https://github.com/PRIME-RE/prime-re.github.io/wiki/){:target="_blank"} contains valuable information about performing MRI research with NHPs. It is not intended as the definitive manual, but rather as a brief primer that can be dynamically updated by the NHP neuroimaging community. Feel free to add to it or make changes. You can also first discuss or pitch what you would like to add. Check your options [here](https://prime-re.github.io/contribute).


# Other tutorials & resources
Numerous other websites also offer nice collections of tutorials (neuroimaging, data analysis, etc) and resources. We list a few of them here as a convenient starting point. If you think we should add something to this list, [let us know](https://github.com/PRIME-RE/prime-re.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Contact&template=contact.md&title=[Contact]:%C2%A0%3Ctopic%3E).
