# PRIME-DRE GCW 2021
We are proud to announce the second biannual **PRIMatE Data and Resource Exchange (PRIME-DRE) Global Collaboration Workshop (GCW)**. Due to the pandemic, this year’s workshop will take place virtually on April 12-14, 2021 (9:30AM-1:30PM EDT). Building on lessons learned from the initial meeting and its outputs, the 2021 meeting will place a particular focus on the generation of collaborative projects that bring together scientists from across the world. Consistent with the model of the highly successful inaugural GCW, held at the Wellcome Trust in London in 2019, the PRIME-DRE GCW will employ a workshop format that consists of a series of breakout sessions and general discussions across four key topic areas, including:

**Topic Area 1: Analysis, Modeling and Informatics: Integrating, Optimizing, and Scaling**    
Leaders: Sean Froudist-Walsh, Ting Xu, Piotr Majka      
Advisors: Damien Fair, Drew Fox, Rogier Mars     

**Topic Area 2: Multiscale, Multimodal Brain Atlas Generation**    
Leaders: Henry Evrard, Amir Shmuel, Afonso Silva     
Advisors: Pascal Belin, Zheng Wang     

**Topic Area 3. Circuit-Level Perturbations: Methods and Applications**    
Leaders: Anna Wang Roe, Melanie Wilke, Chris Klink    
Advisors: Sabine Kastner, Wim Vanduffel    

**Topic Area 4. Generation of Community-level Data Resources**    
Leaders: Colline Poirier, Suliann Ben Hamed, Takuya Hayashi    
Advisors: David Van Essen, Adam Messinger, Chris Petkov     

For each Topic Area, there will be a one-hour breakout session and a one-hour group reporting/discussion session. Topic Areas will be organized sequentially over the three days, so that attendees can participate in breakout and reporting sessions for all four Topic Areas.

# Pre-Workshop Videoconference Schedule
